  Abstract                 = {We consider a particular maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and a computationally intensive Bayesian method for differentially private estimation of the linear mixed-effects model (LMM) with normal random errors. The LMM is important because it is used in small-area estimation and detailed industry tabulations that present significant challenges for confidentiality protection of the underlying data. The differentially private MLE performs well compared to the regular MLE, and deteriorates as the protection increases for a problem in which the small-area variation is at the county level. More dimensions of random effects are needed to adequately represent the time dimension of the data, and for these cases the differentially private MLE cannot be computed. The direct Bayesian approach for the same model uses an informative, reasonably diffuse prior to compute the posterior predictive distribution for the random effects. The empirical differential privacy of this approach is estimated by direct computation of the relevant odds ratios after deleting influential observations according to various criteria.},

We show that the 35 MSAs in the top decile of the house price boom were most severely impacted. Their stable job employment fell much more than the national average. Their real wage rates did not fall as fast as the national average. Accessions fell much faster than average while separations were constant. Job creations fell substantially while destructions rose slightly.},

The current QWI data cover 47 states, about 98\% of the private workforce in those states, and about 92\% of all private employment in the entire economy. State participation is sufficiently extensive to permit us to present the first national estimates constructed from these data. We focus on worker, job, and excess (churning) reallocation rates, rather than on levels of the basic variables. This permits a comparison to existing series from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and the Business Employment Dynamics Series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The national estimates from the QWI are an important enhancement to existing series because they include demographic and industry detail for both worker and job flow data compiled from underlying micro-data that have been integrated at the job and establishment levels by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program at the Census Bureau.

We find that most of productivity growth comes from within firm improvements, leaving a limited role for labour reallocation. Still, we also find that the importance of labour reallocation increase over time. This is both due to increasing net-entry and inter-firm effects. These effects are much more important post 2000 than in the 1990s. We also find that lost production from exiting firms is now most likely replaced by production from existing firms, while previously, it was more likely to be replaced by production from new firms.

  Abstract                 = {When firms are faced with a demand shock, adjustment can take many forms. Firms can adjust physical capital, human capital, or
both. The speed of adjustment may differ as well: costs of adjustment, the type of shock, the legal and economic enviroment all matter.

In this paper, we focus on firms that downsized between 1992 and 1997, but ultimately survive, and investigate how the human capital distribution within
a firm influences the speed of adjustment, {\it ceteris paribus}. In other words, when do firms use mass layoffs instead of attrition to adjust the level
of employment.

We combine worker-level wage records and measures of human capital with firm-level characteristics of the production function, and use levels and
changes in these variables to characterize the choice of adjustment method and speed. Firms are described/compared up to 9 years prior to death. We also
consider how workers fare after leaving downsizing firms, and analyze if observed differences in post-separation outcomes of workers provide clues to
the choice of adjustment speed.},

The final goal of the project described in this paper will be to evaluate whether synthetic data algorithms developed in the U.S. to generate a synthetic version of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) can easily be transferred to generate a similar data product for other countries. We construct a German data product with infor- mation comparable to the LBD - the German Longitudinal Business Database (GLBD) - that is generated from different administrative sources at the Institute for Employment Research, Germany. In a fu- ture step, the algorithms developed for the synthesis of the LBD will be applied to the GLBD. Extensive evaluations will illustrate whether the algorithms provide useful synthetic data without further adjustment. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide access to multiple synthetic datasets similar to the SynLBD at Cornell to enable comparative studies between countries.

However, the confidentiality of this data is a barrier to its utility and curation, making it difficult to fulfill US federal data management mandates and interfering with basic scholarly practices such as validation and reuse of existing results. We describe the complexity of the relationships among data that span a public and private divide. We then describe our work on the CED2AR prototype, a first step in providing researchers with a tool that spans this divide and makes it possible for them to search, access, and cite that data.},

While recording and providing access provenance has always been important, it is even more critical in the web environment in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can be combined and derived. The PROV model, developed under the auspices of the W3C, is a foundation for semantically-rich, interoperable, and web-compatible provenance metadata. We report on the results of our experimentation with integrating the PROV model into the DDI metadata for a complex, but characteristic, example social science data. We also present some preliminary thinking on how to visualize those graphs in the user interface.},

abstract={The Business Dynamics Statistics is a product of the U.S. Census Bureau that provides measures of business openings and closings, and job creation and destruction, by a variety of cross-classifications (firm and establishment age and size, industrial sector, and geography). Sensitive data are currently protected through suppression. However, as additional tabulations are being developed, at ever more detailed geographic levels, the number of suppressions increases dramatically. This paper explores the option of providing public-use data that are analytically valid and without suppressions, by leveraging synthetic data to replace observations in sensitive cells.}

A recently launched project tries to overcome these limitations by improving access to Business Censuses from multiple countries based on synthetic data. Starting from the synthetic version of the longitudinally edited version of the U.S. Business Register (the Longitudinal Business Database, LBD), the idea is to create similar data products in other countries by applying the synthesis methodology developed for the LBD to generate synthetic replicates that could be distributed without confidentiality concerns. In this paper we present some first results of this project based on German business data collected at the Institute for Employment Research.}

  Abstract                 = {This report will provide an overview of methods used by statistical agencies to encourage, support, and
enhance research access to data for the purpose of generating new knowledge. Quite a few reports and
scientific articles have addressed the issue before, and we will be highly indebted to that literature. To a
summary of that literature, we hope to provide some recent developments and experiences derived
from a decade of working with systems that increase access as both researchers as well as data
providers. The report will focus on the data provided by statistical agencies, but it should be understood
that government agencies other than a National Statistical Office (NSO) may acquire that function.
While excluding the legal background limiting or permitting such data collection and provision, we
will highlight some alternate sources and methods, prior to concluding.},

  Abstract                 = {This article studies mobility patterns of German workers in light of a model of sector-specific human capital. Furthermore, I employ and describe little-used data on continuous on-the-job training occuring after apprenticeships. Results are presented describing the incidence and duration of continuous training. Continuous training is quite common, depite the high incidence of apprenticeships which precedes this part of a worker's career. Most previous studies have only distinguished between firm-specific and general human capital, generally concluding that training was general. Inconsistent with those conclusions, I show that German men are more likely to find a job within the same sector if they have received continuous training in that sector. These results are similar to results obtained for young U.S. workers, and suggest that sector-specific capital is an important feature of very different labor markets. Furthermore, the results suggest that the observed effect of training on mobility is sensitive to the state of the business cycle, indicating a more complex interaction between supply and demand that most theoretical models allow for.},

  Abstract                 = {Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), we re-examine the effect of formal on-the-job training on mobility patterns of young American workers. By employing parametric duration models, we evaluate the economic impact of training on productive time with an employer. Confirming previous studies, we find a positive and statistically significant impact of formal on-the-job training on tenure with the employer providing the training. However, expected duration net of the time spent in the training program is generally not significantly increased. We proceed to document and analyze intra-sectoral and cross-sectoral mobility patterns in order to infer whether training provides firm-specific, industry-specific, or general human capital. The econometric analysis rejects a sequential model of job separation in favor of a competing risks specification. We find significant evidence for the industry-specificity of training. The probability of sectoral mobility upon job separation decreases with training received in the current industry, whether with the last employer or previous employers, and employment attachment increases with on-the-job training. These results are robust to a number of variations on the base model.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we look at how labor market conditions at different points during the tenure of individuals with firms are correlated with current earnings. Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel on individuals for the period 1984 to 1994, we find that both the contemporaneous unemployment rate and prior values of the unemployment rate are significantly correlated with current earnings, contrary to results for the American labor market. We interpret this result as evidence that German unions do in fact bargain over both wages and employment, but that the models of individualistic contracts, such as the implicit contract model, may explain some of the observed wage drift and longer-term wage movements reasonably well. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneity of contracts over a variety of worker and job characteristics. In particular, we find evidence that contracts differ across industries and across firm size. Workers of large firms are remarkably more insulated from the job market than workers for any other type of firm, indicating the importance of internal job markets. },
