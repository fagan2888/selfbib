  Abstract                 = {Social science researchers increasingly make use of data that is confidential because it contains linkages to the identities of people, corporations, etc. The value of this data lies in the ability to join the identifiable entities with external data such as genome data, geospatial information, and the like. However, the confidentiality of this data is a barrier to its utility and curation, making it difficult to fulfill US federal data management mandates and interfering with basic scholarly practices such as validation and reuse of existing results. We describe the complexity of the relationships among data that span a public and private divide. We then describe our work on the CED2AR prototype, a first step in providing researchers with a tool that spans this divide and makes it possible for them to search, access, and cite that data.},

  Abstract		={Many applications (e.g., anomaly detection) concern sparse signals. This paper focuses on the problem of recovering a K-sparse signal $x \in R/1\times N$, i.e., $K \leq \leq N$ and $\sum N/i = 1\ 1\lbrace x_i \neq 0 \rbrace = K$. In the mainstream framework of compressed sensing (CS), × is recovered from M linear measurements y = xS ∈ R/1×M, where S ∈ RN×M is often a Gaussian (or Gaussian-like) design matrix.

In our proposed method, the design matrix S is generated from an α-stable distribution with α ≈ 0. Our decoding algorithm mainly requires one linear scan of the coordinates, followed by a few iterations on a small number of coordinates which are "undetermined" in the previous iteration. Our practical algorithm consists of two estimators. In the first iteration, the (absolute) minimum estimator is able to filter out a majority of the zero coordinates. The gap estimator, which is applied in each iteration, can accurately recover the magnitudes of the nonzero coordinates. Comparisons with linear programming (LP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) demonstrate that our algorithm can be significantly faster in decoding speed and more accurate in recovery quality, for the task of exact spare recovery. Our procedure is robust against measurement noise. Even when there are no sufficient measurements, our algorithm can still reliably recover a significant portion of the nonzero coordinates.},
